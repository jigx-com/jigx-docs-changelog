### Mobile Apps

New features & improvements

- Enhanced error message display by adding detailed information to error toasts.
- Improve performance by caching the evaluation of expression.
- Updated the wording on the 'Out of Date' screen.
- Android performance - Significant optimizations to improve performance, especially for expressions handling.

### Components

New features & improvements

- [duration-picker]() - The duration-picker in a form allows you to specify a time duration easily by providing a user-friendly interface where you can scroll or tap to select hours or minutes rather than manually typing in numbers. It's particularly useful for tasks that require tracking time intervals, like logging work shifts, break times, time spent on a particular task, or time-based billing. For example, an app user needs to record the time spent performing a certain activity, a duration-picker lets them choose the time.
- [Lists]() - Enhanced list functionality for a better user experience: We've expanded the functionality of lists to enhance how you display content in both vertical and horizontal orientations.

  - [Card-wrapping](): Wrap list items in cards for a more visually appealing presentation.
  - [Rating]() : Add ratings to list items using values or percentages. Customize the rating icons and select their colors for better visual alignment.
  - [Tags](): Add multiple tags to list items with the flexibility to customize tag colors. Tags appear at the bottom of each list item, providing additional context at a glance.
  - [Badges]() : Enhanced the `rightElement: badge` property to allow badge numbers to display on the right of each list-item. Configure badges to show as dots or as numerical counts, giving you more control over how information is presented. See [jig.list]() , and [list-item]() component for more information.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where the `summary` component did not hide correctly when set to `false`, affecting `summary` components and summaries with actions.
- Fixed an issue where the time modal in the `date-picker` appeared compressed, rendering it nearly invisible and non-functional.

### Builder

New features & improvements

- Conversions in [File handling]() - You can now use expressions to create conversions when executing an entity, providing greater flexibility at runtime. Previously limited to static options, this update enables dynamic adjustments, making your app more adaptable and responsive. This improvement applies to the `conversions` property in both local and global actions, allowing you to define an array of definitions returned by an expression using:
  `conversions: =@ctx.datasources.conversions`

:::CodeblockTabs
conversions-action

```yaml
- type: action.execute-entity
    options:
      title: Save
      provider: DATA_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC
      entity: default/category
      method: save
      data:
        id: =@ctx.jig.inputs.categoryId
        name: =@ctx.components.name.state.value
        description: =@ctx.components.description.state.value
        # reference the image using an expression 
        image: =@ctx.components.image.state.value
# The conversions for an array of definitions returned by an expression,
# rather than a static definition.          
      conversions: =@ctx.datasources.conversions 
```

datasource

```yaml
type: datasource.sqlite
options:
  provider: DATA_PROVIDER_DYNAMIC
  entities:
    - default/category
  query: |
    SELECT id, '$.name', '$.description', '$.image'
    FROM [default/category]
    ORDER BY [name]
  conversions:
    - property: image
      from: base64
      to: local-uri
```
:::

Bug Fixes

- Resolved an error with lists nested within lists, making complex data handling more reliable.

### Jigx Management

Bug Fixes

- General improvements.

### Change in behavior

- The `goBack` property in `execute-entity/entities` and `submit-form` actions behavior has changed. For backward compatibility, existing `goBack` properties in these actions will still function as before. If you have any default behavior in a solution where a `goBack` has not been specified in the actions (execute-entity/entities or submit-form) it will go to the previous screen. After publishing the solution, the jig will stay on the current jig.
  - **Previous behavior**: By default, the `execute-entity/entities` and `submit-form` actions would return to the previous jig or screen (Home Hub) after execution.
  - **New behavior**: The default behavior is now to remain on the current jig (screen) after these actions are executed. If you need to go back to the previous jig, you can now configure an explicit [go-back]()  action (`action.go-back`) to achieve this behavior.

### Known issues

- *Issue:* When using a SELECT statement in a datasource query that does not return an `id` in the result set, and the dataset is large, it can negatively affect the solution's performance. This is especially noticeable when the data is used in a dropdown.
  *Workaround:* Ensure that the query always returns a unique `id` in the dataset. The `id` must be lowercase.
- **Issue**: When using the `color` property in a number related component, such as `number-field` or `duration-picker`,  and the `when` property uses an expression to determine the `color` based on a condition such as > or \<, the `color` does not display as expected.
  **Workaround**: The `color` property will display correctly if the `when` property is set to a simple true/false condition rather than a complex expression.

### Updates to documentation

- Added [duration-picker]() documentation and code examples.&#x20;
- Added examples of list rating, tags, wrapping, and badging to [jig.list]() , [list]()  and <a href="https://docs.jigx.com/examples/9Auy-list" target="_blank">list widgets</a>.
- Updated [File handling]() topic with using expressions in conversions.

### Updates to Quick-Start sample solutions

| **Solution** | **Update or addition**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| jigx-samples | - Updated finance-charts.jigx datasource.

|                 |                  |
| --------------- | ---------------- |
| Release date    |  24 October 2024 |
| iOS version     | 1.58.1           |
| Android version | 1.58.1           |
| Jigx Builder    | 1.33.0           |

### Mobile Apps & Builder

New features & improvements

- [REST error handling]() - Errors returned by REST endpoints are often too technical for end-users to understand. Jigx allows you to customize these error messages, enhancing user experience by making the messages clearer and ensuring users know the error is not their fault. Additionally, you can configure how to handle items in an error state, such as retrying the operation or deleting the item. For code examples see [REST errors]().
- Additional information on error handling for datasources has been added. Global datasources, which previously failed silently, now display an error screen when issues occur. Local datasources also trigger an error screen when errors are encountered, with detailed error logs providing additional context.
  The following errors are detected, with details displayed on the error screen:
  - **Non-existent datasource error**: This occurs when a datasource cannot be found, often due to an outdated name, a typo in an expression, or a missing table in the default file.
  - **Query processing error**: This occurs during the execution of a datasource query, such as when an SQLite query contains syntax or logic errors.
- Added the ability to use solution settings expressions to build default values for parameter values in function files, for example:
  `value: =@ctx.solution.settings.custom.restStorageApiKey`

### Deprecated

- The `errorTransform` property in REST functions has been deprecated. If you currently have `errorTransform` configured in your function, the solution will continue to function as expected to support backward compatibility. Jigx recommends you update the function file to use the new [REST error handling]() properties that provide greater control over errors returned from the REST service.

### Known issues

- *Issue:* When using a SELECT statement in a datasource query that does not return an `id` in the result set, and the dataset is large, it can negatively affect the solution's performance. This is especially noticeable when the data is used in a dropdown.
  *Workaround:*
  Ensure that the query always returns a unique `id` in the dataset. The `id` must be lowercase.

### Updates to documentation

- Add [REST error handling]()  and [REST errors]().

| Android version | 1.55.21          |
| Jigx Builder    | 1.32.0           |

### Mobile Apps

New features & improvements

- **List filters -** Set the filter to open on a specific tab in a list. The filter property's YAML snippet has changed to include the `data` (required) and `initialValue` (optional) properties. The existing filter configuration will continue to work, but the YAML snippet is squiggled in red to indicate that the new `data` property is required. The filter now handles strings and booleans, ensure the `value` for filter is configured correctly. For more information see [list]() and [jig.list]().

:::CodeblockTabs
filter-yaml-snippet

```yaml
filter:
    initialValue: "inactive"
    data:
      - title: All
        value: ""
      - title: Active
        value: active
      - title: Inactive
        value: inactive
```
:::

- **Keyboard**: Introduced the option to hide the mobile keyboard on iOS devices on default jigs that require user input, such as forms. You can either tap the keyboard icon or click outside the keyboard to dismiss it and view the full screen.

- Design your app to respond to the **device type** and **orientation**.
  Added two new system variables namely:
  \- `deviceType`: The variable returns the current user's device type, such as tablet or handset, when using the expression `=@ctx.system.deviceType`. This expression is useful for determining the appropriate image size based on the device type.
  \- `isPortrait`: The variable is set with a boolean and is used to configure the behavior of components in either portrait or landscape mode. The expression's structure is `=@ctx.system.isPortrait`.

Bug Fixes

- Improved the user login experience through improved animations for the transitions between the different screens.
- Fixed translations on `info-modal` action.
- When opening a `modal`, for example, in a `dropdown` or `media-field`, while the keyboard was open would break the view.

### Components

New features & improvements

- [Choice-field]() improvements include:
  - Improved the rending of the choice-field component in an expander component.
  - The `itemsPerRow` property now supports multiline (up to two-lines) text ensuring that text is not cutoff.
  - Improved the padding of the choice-field to be consistent with all other components.
  - `isMultiple` now supports expressions.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed localization for `choice` and `dropdown` components.
- Fixed layout issues for `choice` component within `card` component.
- Fixed an issue where a `web-view` component within an `expander` was crashing an Android app.

### Builder

New features & improvements

- ****[Device type and orientation expressions](): Added two new system variables namely:
  \- `deviceType`: The variable returns the current user's device type, such as tablet or handset, when using the expression `=@ctx.system.deviceType`. This expression is useful for determining the appropriate image size based on the device type.
  \- `isPortrait`: The variable is set with a boolean and is used to configure the behavior of components in either portrait or landscape mode. The expression's structure is `=@ctx.system.isPortrait`.
- [JavaScript Expressions]()** - **You can now use JavaScript functions in expressions to streamline logic within your solutions. This feature simplifies repetitive and complex tasks, making the code more readable, understandable, and easier to debug. JavaScript functions are created in the scripts/expressions folder, and are surfaced as expressions in the YAML within Jigx Builder. New solutions open with the scripts/expressions folder structure; existing solutions will not have the folder; you can manually add the folder to these solutions. For code examples see [JavaScript expressions]().

Bug Fixes

- Added a user-friendly warning message when list data and sections are combined stating: "Combining 'sections' and 'data' properties together is not allowed. Use either the 'data' or 'sections' property exclusively."
- Fixed an issue with inserting icons in different jigs. Previously the snippets were incorrect and resulted in you being unable to set up the icons.
- Fixed an issue where you weren't able to use shorthand to reference shared expressions.
- Jigx logs would crash when using dynamic conditional logic on a datasource with no records.
- Fixed errors in the console for incomplete data provider setups.
- Fixed link on deployment toast to navigate to output window.

### Jigx Management

Bug Fixes

- General improvements.

### Known issues

- *Issue:* When using a SELECT statement in a datasource query that does not return an `id` in the result set, and the dataset is large, it can negatively affect the solution's performance. This is especially noticeable when the data is used in a dropdown.
  *Workaround:*
  Ensure that the query always returns a unique `id` in the dataset. The `id` must be lowercase.

### Updates to documentation

- Added [Best practice]() topic on when to use state, inputs and outputs.
- How to [update multiple records in a single REST call]().
- Added examples to filtering a [jig.list]() and filtering the [list]() component, showing how to open a specific tab using the `initialValue` property.
- Added [JavaScript functions]() to the expressions topic and [JavaScript expressions]() code samples.

  ::Image[]{src="https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/vivuYJoEYbI9aA9wxEhln_jm-troubleshooting.PNG" signedSrc="https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/vivuYJoEYbI9aA9wxEhln_jm-troubleshooting.PNG" size="60" width="2540" height="2500" position="center" caption alt}
- Added the ability to tap on a widget to trigger an action by adding an `onPress` event to the widget properties. See the widget [onPress]() example for more information.
- [Offline remote data handling]() - Dealing with offline remote data is fundamental to ensuring data synchronization between the mobile app and the remote data source, allowing users to continue using the app and performing actions without interruption. Queue operations provide the functionality needed when the device regains network connectivity. `QueueOperations` manage a sequence of elements in a specific order. The commands in the queue can be manipulated to reduce the number of calls to the remote data store.
- Added a setting to display the current solution version in the profile>solutions screen.
- Improved SSO handling and general SSO improvements.
- Added handling of REST array types.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with the app freezing on the splash screen when offline.
- Fixed an issue with double encoding of URLs in `action.open-url`.
- Fixed an issue with organizational information not being returned in multi-organization environments (e.g. `@ctx.organization.id`).
- Fixed an issue with deep-linking from notifications into the app on Android.

### Components

New features & improvements

- [Carousel]() component - The carousel is an interactive component that lets you swipe through a set of items, making content navigation engaging and dynamic. For example, images, products, or content can be browsed by swiping left or right. In addition to swipe gestures, navigation identifiers are included in dots or a counter. The dots/counter indicate the current position within the carousel.
- [info-modal]() action - The info modal is a pop-up window that provides additional information or context without navigating away from the current screen. It displays additional information and offers guidance or instructions.
- [media-field]() - now includes uploading files, images, videos, or a combination. The number of images allowed to be selected in the `component.media-picker` has been increased.
- [Convert HEIC to JPEG]() in `conversions`—Files are uploaded as HEIC files on iOS, which can cause issues, and viewing HEIC files on a non-iOS device is difficult. A new property has been added in the `ConversionDefinition: convertHeicToJpg`. Set the flag to `true`, and the files are converted from HEIC to JPG.
- [card]() component - The card is a versatile and visually appealing UI element that encapsulates and presents information or interactive content in a structured, consistent, and user-friendly manner. Each card can include a mix of text, images, and interactive elements, creating a self-contained content unit.
- Added the ability to interact with disabled image groups in the `component.interactive-image`.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue with `allDay` events in `component.event`.

### Builder

Bug Fixes

- Improved Jigx debug windows making long values easier to read, especially for function parameter, parameter, and inputs.
- Fixed the `=@ctx.solution.settings` in the context of expressions when specified.
- Fixed the expression `=@ctx.solution.organizationId` and `=@ctx.solution.solutionId` to return the correct value.
- Fixed intelliSense to show `@ctx` in data columns.

### Management

Bug Fixes

- General improvements and bug fixes.

### Change in behavior

- Solutions listed in the Jigx App (not branded apps) will now be filtered according to the app's current region.
  Previously, all solutions were loaded regardless of the apps and/or organization's region. Now, solutions will load based on whether their organization's region matches the app's region.
  To ensure the Jigx App region matches your organization's region, you can go to Jigx Management to see what the *Organization Settings* are. By default, the mobile app logs into the US East region. To change your mobile device's *Home Region,* go to *Profile > Settings* to match the organization's region in Jigx Management.
  This change prevents credential and connection lookup failures across regions.

Bug fixes

- Intellisense presented an invalid option. The `function` and `functionParameters` Intellisense options have been removed from the SQLite datasource YAML snippet. Instead, use `sync-entities`, which allows you to configure the `function` and `functionParameter` needed to get data onto a device.

### Components

Bug fixes

- Fixed the `component.bar-chart` that was not working correctly when no y-data was specified.
- Fixed an issue with the loading behavior of the `component.location`.
- Fixed an issue with the performance when getting blob or base64 data of `component.media-field`.
- Fixed an issue with `component.expander` and deleting of list-items when the expander was expanded.

### Management

New features & improvements

- Dynamic Data record types - You can toggle between data types using the sparkler on the right of each data field and then save the record, for example, from string to number. See [Change a data record type]() for more information.

## Release 2024.3

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/jyaBdn2E0rofmFPvxS7-I_release-243.png)

|                     | **Versions & dates** |
| ------------------- | -------------------- |
| **Release date**    | 22 March 2024        |
| **iOS version**     | 1.24.7               |
| **Android version** | 1.24.7               |

### Mobile Apps

Bug Fixes

- Fixed an issue where an expression could not be used in the `title` property of the `component.section`.
- Fixed bar charts where the bar was visually pushed up when specifying points outside the minimum and maximum range.
- When public content in management was configured to enable the Request Access link, clicking on any of the widgets on a tablet (IOS and Android) gave a screen not found error.
- Fixed an issue with the `onPress` event of swipeable actions that were not triggered if a list was set to `initiallyCollapsed: true`.

Known Issue

- When a `jig.list` re-renders, e.g., after a list item is deleted, and the `jig.list` property `initiallyCollapsed: true` is set, the list appears blank.
  **Workaround:**
  Avoid using the `initiallyCollapsed: true` property in this scenario. Collapsing and expanding the list or navigating away from the jig and back will render the list items again.

### Management

New features & improvements

- Improved the setting up of public content on an organizational level for branded apps. The improvements include JSON and YAML tabs that allow you to toggle between the files, ensuring that the JSON and YAML values are validated. Validation messages are shown to help you troubleshoot errors. See [Public Content]() for more information.
- Find solutions faster - The solution search field on the list of solutions now supports the GUID and partial name/title.
- Improved error handling and validation.
- Performance improvements and security enhancements.

Bug Fixes

- General bug fixes.

## Release 2024.2

![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/4KZTBHXYBT-6cvlutlKcY_release-242-2.png)

| **iOS version**          | 1.23.2               |
| **Android version**      | 1.23.2               |
| **Jigx Builder version** | 1.26.0               |

### Mobile Apps

New features & improvements

- Added the ability to deep link from a jig to an external app using the [open-url]() action, for example, opening Google Maps from an address link in a contacts list jig. For more information, see [deep links]() and [open-url]().

Bug Fixes

- Fixed animation on checkboxes.
- Fixed the issue on `charts` where an expression didn't populate the x-axis correctly.
- Fixed the incorrect jailbreak/rooted error received on specific mobile devices.

### Builder

New features & improvements

- *Dynamically sync-entities* - When building a solution, the number of entities to sync and the parameters for each are not always known; for example, when syncing the attachments, files, and documents from a source, there can be zero, one, or more. It is necessary to dynamically specify a list of the entities, functions, and function parameters to return from the input source using an expression. For more information, see [Dynamically sync multiple entities]().
- Best practice for production apps is to use REST as the data layer to access data and not directly integrate to SQL using the SQL data provider. The SQL data provider will be squiggled in blue to indicate it is not recommended, together with a message to use REST instead. 
- Use a  [scenario template]() to quickly create a *contacts management *solution. The solution consists of forms to create a new contact, view the contact details, edit the details, and list all your contacts. It is easy to customize the template for similar solutions.
- Added [Widget Templates]() - Using widget templates significantly speeds up the development process. These templates provide a pre-built structure for the various [types of widgets]() that can be customized as needed. Widget templates are only available on widgets with a `size` setting of  2x2 or greater.
- If an expression has a chain of single options, IntelliSense will add it at once.

Bug Fixes

- Fixed the incorrect validation error of the `url` property within a function's continuation configuration.
- Fixed an issue where the cursor jumps to a new line after selecting an IntelliSense option.
- Fixed an issue where IntelliSense didn't invoke an empty `children` array.

### Management

New features & improvements

- Added the ability to clean up [favorite solutions]() and to remove favorite entries that are no longer available. This is useful when a solution is deleted, or you can no longer see the solution in the list. Only the last 5 solutions pinned as favorites are tracked. This enhancement provides a quick indicator that a frequented solution from management is no longer available.
  ![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/aZbFx-iNsZ6smoytCDG1y_jm-favoritecleanup.png)
- Creating a copy of a solution duplicates the structure of the credentials and connections to allow for easy configuration by only having to respecify secrets.
- Widgets and stories now indicate when non-group-assigned items are inaccessible by anyone. Once access is applied, access is granted according to the applied permissions.
  ![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/ZAxuFLZUQBWUbi-ofpLrC_jm-widgetnoaccess.png)
- Added a visible *Edit groups* link to the solutions permissions tab making it easier to edit group access to the solution.
  ![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/YQEv_s2grP81KrkXfkqFX_jm-editgroups.png)
- Changed help icons to open in a new tab rather than in a widget.
- Added an indication of the solution count per organization on the [User > Profile - Organizations]() section. This is useful for people belonging to multi-organizations. On the user's profile, all organizations assigned to the user are visible with an active solution count. Clicking on an organization will easily switch you to that organization where solutions are assigned; go to the Solutions tab, and manipulate access as required.
  ![](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/MrXjDx_SvJuwQya4LlhP0_jm-solutioncount.png)
- Added an *Idle logout minutes* option for Jigx Management. This is an optional security setting that, once applied, will display a prompt and then log the person out of  Jigx Management after being idle for the configured period. Enabling the checkbox has a default of 120 minutes but is configurable to your requirements. See [Advanced Setting]() for more information.
