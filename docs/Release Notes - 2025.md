### Components and jig types

New features & improvements

- [jig.table]() - The table jig displays structured data in rows and columns, allowing users to view and interact with multiple records within the app.
- [media-field]() -The media-field picker allows users to view and upload media files, with configurable filters to restrict document file types (e.g., PDF, DOC, PPT, or plainText) based on your app’s requirements.
- [bottomSheet (Beta)]() - The bottomSheet slides up from the bottom of the screen to display contextual content or actions without leaving the current screen. Ideal for menus, filters, forms, or quick actions.

### Actions

New features & improvements

- Improvements have been made to the [generate-file]() functionality, specifically related to encoding reliability and consistency.
- [open-app-settings]() - The action directs users straight to the app’s settings page, helping them quickly find and adjust permissions without needing to navigate through their device settings manually.

### Builder

New features & improvements

- [Custom variables]() - IntelliSense now displays the variables configured in Jigx Management > Solution Settings when using the `=@ctx.solution.settings.custom.{{variableName}}` expression. After adding a new custom variable in Management, you can use IntelliSense's  *Reload Solution Settings* option to update data from Jigx Management and make the variable visible in IntelliSense.

### Important Updates and Migration Guidance

Release 2025.1 introduces significant changes to existing functionality, components, and actions, along with new features that may impact existing solutions. While every effort has been made to provide [migration plans]() to ensure backward compatibility, once a solution is published on this release, the changes will take effect. The primary areas impacted include the home screen (index.jigx), location component, go-to action, widgets, and stories.

- Jigx strongly recommends thoroughly testing all solutions after publishing to ensure expected behavior and stability.
- The documentation is being updated to reflect the latest product offerings. As a result, some screenshots and code samples may not yet represent the most recent features and improvements.

### Mobile Apps

New features & improvements

- [go-to]() action - The action allows you to open a jig as a modal. Simply set the `isModal` property to `true`.
- [Navigation]()  - The [go-to]() action is used to configure the flow of jigs in the app using the `behaviour` property. With the `behaviour` you determine if you want to push the screen into the app history, by using the `new` value, or show the one you already have in history by using the `existing` value.
- [Grid]() and [custom tabs]()  used to create Home Hub and bottom navigation bar. For backward compatibility - see [Migration plan]() to understand the changes that are required when republishing the solution.
- [jig.grid]()  - Create grid layouts in your app, organizing content into rows and columns for a visually consistent and flexible interface. It helps align elements proportionally, ensuring a structured design. The grid is ideal for creating galleries to display photos or product images, as well as dashboards, menus, and product lists.
- The home button has been removed from jigs and the profile button has been moved to the new bottom navigation tab bar. See [Home Hub]() for more information.&#x20;
- Added the ability to remove the Support menu from the user profile screen. This can be configured via a flag in the build configuration.
- Solution switching has been moved to the Profile settings screen.

### Components and jig types

New features & improvements

- [jig.tabs]() - Tabs is a new jig type that allows you to navigate between different jigs with ease, enhancing the user experience by providing an organized layout.
- [jig.grid]()  - This jig type enables you to create grid layouts in your app, organizing content into rows and columns for a visually consistent and flexible interface. The grid is ideal for creating galleries to display photos or product images.
- [Grid component]() - create a grid layout as a component in a jig with other components.
- [Divider]() -create a simple divider between components using the `component.divider`. The divider component adds a simple dark horizontal line across the screen. Common use cases include grouping related content or enhancing visual hierarchy.
- [segmented-control]() - create a horizontal control consisting of segments that allows you to** **toggle between multiple options in a compact, efficient way.
- Actions added on [jig-header]() - Configure actions to display as links or icons in the top right corner of the header.
- Enhanced the `media-picker’s` usability by reducing clicks/taps during the upload process.
- `List `and `list-items` improvements include:
  - Added support for using a [list-item outside a list]() component. This allows configuring a single list item with all list-item features, such as left and right elements and swipe actions, without requiring a full list. See a code example [Single list-item in an expander]()
  - Enhanced the `list-item` description to support multiple lines.
  - Added color support to the `value` property of the list's `rightElement`.
- Multiple enhancements made to `location` component, including support for custom markers, different markers based on a state, user's location display, and follow a user location.** Note:** A [Migration plan]() is in place to ensure backward compatibility for existing solutions. However, once a solution is republished, you must update the code to ensure the location component continues to function as expected.
- Multiple improvements made to the `expander` component, including:
  - Determine the background color for header versus body using the `variant` property with `plain` or `emphasis` values.
  - Expander arrow align left or right.
  - Added the ability to add a solid or transparent `divider`.

### Change in behavior

- *Backwards compatibility* - When a widget displayed on the Home Hub  and no specific icon was configured, a default icon of four squares was shown. In existing solutions the four squares are now replaced with a default heart icon. You can change the icon by configuring the `icon` property in each jig file.

### Deprecated

- The `story-group` component and `stories` property in index.jigx has been removed for all new and existing solutions. If you currently use stories on your home screen they will no longer appear in the app and in Jigx Builder the YAML will have red squiggles. Remove the YAML in Jigx Builder and republish.
- The ability to set access to widgets in a solution in Jigx Management for users and groups has been removed.
- The `home` property in index.jigx used to display a custom Home Hub has been removed. Reference the custom home jig under the new `tabs` property. See [Creating a Home Hub]() for more details.
