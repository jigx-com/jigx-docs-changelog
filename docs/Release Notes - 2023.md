| ------------------------ | -------------------- |
| **Release date**         | 14 December 2023     |
| **iOS version**          | 1.15.0               |
| **Android version**      | 1.0.0                |
| **Jigx Builder version** | 1.24.0               |

#### Mobile Apps

New Features & improvements

* Added ability to have a solution with only a custom Home Hub and without a widget-based (default) Home Hub. See [Home Hub](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) and [Custom Home Hub](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) for more information.
* Added global/shared actions to solutions. See [Actions](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) for more information.
* Improved the general file and photo upload experience.

Bug Fixes

* Fixed issue with animated icons/placeholders on iOS 17+ devices.
* Fixed an issue with the app restarting when the auth token fails.
* Fixed various theming/UI issues.

#### Components

New Features & improvements

* Added auto-include of http/https URI prefixes in various components, e.g., `action.open-url`

Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with `mediaType:any` in components that upload files to OneDrive.
* Fixed an issue with the `component.signature` that was not working correctly on Android 13+ devices.

#### Builder

New Features & improvements

* Shared (Global) actions - Shared actions enable creators to define an effort once and reuse it across multiple Jigs. New solutions open with the action folder structure; existing solutions will not have the folder; you need to manually add the folder for these solutions. See [global actions](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) for more information.
* [Salesforce](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) provider now recognizes standard Salesforce objects and provides a list of these when using IntelliSense in Jigx Builder. Note that custom objects need to be manually added and will be squiggled in blue to indicate the Salesforce entity is unknown. Ignore this warning if the entity is custom.

* General improvements have been implemented in snippets to enhance usability.
* In \`index\`, `widget` configuration now provides a quick fix to address problems related to invalid jig references.
* Moved assets (icons and images) from index.jigx to a new assets folder. The icons.jigx and images.jigx files are automatically created for you under the folder.
  1. \*Icons - \*For **existing** solutions the icon.jigx is automatically created but the assets `icon` entries from the index.jigx file must be manually deleted.
  2. \*Images - \*For **existing** solutions the image.jigx is automatically created with images referenced in jig `headers`, but the assets `image` entries from the index.jigx file must be manually copied over to the images.jigx file and deleted from the index.jigx file.

For more information see [Assets](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).

![Assets folder](https://archbee-image-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/x7vdIDH6-ScTprfmi2XXX/p55r-nUQgHaxSfagUPh5D_assets.png)

Bug Fixes

* Resolved a problem related to the preview of `icons`, enhancing visibility
* Addressed a validation issue where an `icon` was incorrectly highlighted if the name consisted of only one character.
* Resolved a problem where deleted items were still accessible in IntelliSense.
* Fixed a validation issue where a valid parameter was erroneously highlighted.

#### Jigx Management

New Features & improvements

* Ability to delete unused data tables for Dynamic Data . For more information see [Deleting tables](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).
* Add the ability for support to set Organization and Solution limits, read-only access for non-SUPPORT users.

Bug Fixes

* Bug fixes and performance improvements

#### Breaking Changes

* When working with the REST or SQL providers that use files, or datastores with files and actions with files, and you used base64 or buffer you must update your YAML to use the new `conversions` property. The change stores the image files as local files on the device and only saves the file uri to the file in the datastore/state. When a component needs the actual binary data, it reads the local file from the file uri. Previously the call in the jig would be similar to `=@ctx.components.image.state.base64` or `=@ctx.components.profilePicture.state.blob`. The new `conversion` property allows for the call to use: `=@ctx.components.image.state.value` or `=@ctx.components.profilePicture.state.value`.
* For more information, see [File handling](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).

* Automatically adds icons used in the solution to `assets:` in index.jigx, ensuring icons are visible when the device is offline. For more information, see [Icon assets in solutions](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).

Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue with `isScrollable: false` not setting the location component to full screen
* Fixed an issue with a solution without widgets not opening the settings side panel on tablets

#### Components

New Features & improvements

* Added a new component called `component.countdown`. For more information and code samples see [countdown](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).

#### Jigx Management

New features & improvements

* Dynamic Data - Added Row Level Security (RLS) through security policies and authorization. For more information, see [Row Level Security](<Release Notes - 2023.md>), [Data policies](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) and [Authorized users](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).
  * When upgrading to 2023.12, existing Dynamic Data tables will have the `Allow Everyone` restriction set for all CRUD methods in the data policies setting in Jigx Management. No Authorized Users (`Owners` or `Members`) are set for data records. You must manually set the Authorized Users for each data record in each table according to your security requirements.
  * **Recommendation:** With the introduction of row-level-security (RLS), Jigx recommends you re-deploy existing solutions to enforce the latest so that policies work correctly. Enforce minimum version to 2023.12 to ensure policies operate as expected.
* Added JSON support to Dynamic Data. You can upload data using a JSON or CSV file. For more information, see [Dynamic Data](<Release Notes - 2023.md>).
* Ability to pin five of your favorite solutions to the top of the solutions page for quick access. See [Favorite Solutions](<Release Notes - 2023.md>) for more details.

In Jigx Builder the `name` property displays with red validation squiggles. Hover over the validation issue to see the available icon property. For example:

:::::VerticalSplit{layout="middle"} ::::VerticalSplitItem :::CodeblockTabs Before

```yaml
 leftElement:
      element: icon
      name: =@ctx.current.item.icon
      isContained: true
      isDuotone: true
 
 rightElement: 
      element: icon
      name: =(@ctx.current.item.materials = true ? 'attachment' :'alert-triangle')
     
```

::: ::::

::::VerticalSplitItem :::CodeblockTabs After

#### Jigx Management

Bug Fixes

* General improvements and bug fixes

#### Breaking Changes

Certain properties can be deprecated or changed in Jigx Builder between versions. To ensure that solutions continue to function on the device, Jigx has added the ability to transform a solution's definition to comply with the current application's schema version during runtime. This means that the following can occur:

1. When the Jigx App version is greater than the Jigx Builder version, solutions will continue to work in the Jigx mobile app, while in Jigx Builder the deprecated property displays with red validation squiggles. Hover over the validation issue to see the available property options.
2. When the Jigx Builder version is greater than the Jigx App version, the mobile app displays the _Out of date_ screen. Update the app by tapping the \*Update \*button which will direct you to the latest version of the Jigx App in the App Store or Google Play Store.
